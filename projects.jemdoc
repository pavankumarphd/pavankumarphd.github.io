. *Drone and UAV facility* \n Funding Agency: Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Limited (KPTCL) \n Year of Award: 2022 \n Amount: ₹ 25,10,000 \n Project funding is for development of State of the Art Drone and Unmanned aerial vehicle laboratory similar to a Center of Excellence for research and development activities.

== Co-Principal Investigator
. *Large Language Model for Legal Assistance* \n  Funding Agency: IIT Mandi iHub and HCI Foundation \n Principal Investigator: Dr. Sunil Saumya \n Duration: Duration: January, 2025 -- December, 2026 \n Amount: ₹ 17,32,500 \n The research aims to create an innovative legal assistance system using LLM technology. It involves developing algorithms for legal document summarization, translation, and counseling, followed by testing and validation with input from users and professionals. After successful development, the system will be deployed through digital platforms such as smart phone applications or website, with training programs to ensure effective use. 

== Co-Investigator
. *Autonomous Navigating Humanoid* \n Funding Agency: Technology Innovation Hub on Autonomous Navigation and Data Acquisition Systems,  IIT Hyderabad \n Principal Investigator: Dr. Deepak K. T. \n Duration: May, 2021 -- April, 2024 \n Amount: ₹ 70,00,000 \n Project involves development of Autonomous Navigating Humanoids for assisting in geriatric care. Humanoid features are planned for assisting in geriatric care in a household setup adapting to the existing obstacles. Speech processing, visual recognition and navigation capability modules/algorithms will be developed for the humanoid with emphasis on machine learning and deep learning techniques.

== Joint Investigator
. *Integration of IRNSS receiver with Mapping services* \n Funding Agency: Space Applications Centre, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) \n Principal Investigator: Dr. R. Selvakumar \n Duration: March, 2017 -- August, 2019 \n Amount: ₹ 14,35,000 \n IRNSS receiver worth ₹ 12,00,000 is provided to VIT through MoU for the research purpose and carrying out the project apart from the above mentioned project amount. \n India has developed its own Navigational satellite system for Indian region called as Indian Regional Navigational Satellite System (IRNSS). Also, called as NAVigation with Indian Constellation (NAVIC). The project involved development of tracking system for fleets on Maps such as Google 2D, Google 3D, ISRO Bhuvan 2D and Bhuvan 3D using IRNSS receiver signals and termed accordingly as NAVIC fleet tracking system.
. *Reliable and Secured Space Communication based on fundamental cut-sets and fundamental circuits in Graphs* \n Funding Agency: Space Applications Centre, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) \n Principal Investigator: Dr. R. Selvakumar \n Duration: December, 2013 -- November, 2015 \n Amount: ₹ 14,00,000 \n Reliable and Secure communication has been a challenge in real time communication systems. To attain the goal of reliability and security, a reliable and secure communication system is developed by using principles of coding theory and cryptography. A new class of error correcting codes called Concatenated Kernel Codes was proposed to attain reliability in communication by correcting errors, if any, occurred during transmission. To achieve security the proposed Concatenated Kernel codes was represented using Trellis. Over the graph nature of Trellis, using principles of graph theory - namely fundamental cut-set and fundamental circuits, light weight authentication protocol was designed to provide security against the possible attacks during transmission in communication channel. Various possible attack strategies were simulated and tested on designed system to check the robustness of proposed cryptosystem and is shown that by adopting proposed reliable and secure cryptosystem coding gain as well as security can be achieved without incurring additional overhead on data transmitted in communication channel. \n /Remark: Completed with Excellent grade from SAC, ISRO/.
