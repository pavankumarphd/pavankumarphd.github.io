. *Integration of IRNSS receiver with Mapping services* \n Funding Agency: Space Applications Centre, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) \n Principal Investigator: Dr. R. Selvakumar \n Duration: March, 2017 -- August, 2019 \n Amount: Rs. 14,35,000 \n IRNSS receiver worth Rs.12,00,000 is provided to VIT through MoU for the research purpose and carrying out the project apart from the above mentioned project amount. \n India has developed its own Navigational satellite system for Indian region called as Indian Regional Navigational Satellite System (IRNSS). Also, called as NAVigation with Indian Constellation (NAVIC). The project involved development of tracking system for fleets on Maps such as Google 2D, Google 3D, ISRO Bhuvan 2D and Bhuvan 3D using IRNSS receiver signals and termed accordingly as NAVIC fleet tracking system.
. *Reliable and Secured Space Communication based on fundamental cut-sets and fundamental circuits in Graphs* \n Funding Agency: Space Applications Centre, Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) \n Principal Investigator: Dr. R. Selvakumar \n Duration: December, 2013 -- November, 2015 \n Amount: Rs. 14,00,000 \n Reliable and Secure communication has been a challenge in real time communication systems. To attain the goal of reliability and security, a reliable and secure communication system is developed by using principles of coding theory and cryptography. A new class of error correcting codes called Concatenated Kernel Codes was proposed to attain reliability in communication by correcting errors, if any, occurred during transmission. To achieve security the proposed Concatenated Kernel codes was represented using Trellis. Over the graph nature of Trellis, using principles of graph theory - namely fundamental cut-set and fundamental circuits, light weight authentication protocol was designed to provide security against the possible attacks during transmission in communication channel. Various possible attack strategies were simulated and tested on designed system to check the robustness of proposed cryptosystem and is shown that by adopting proposed reliable and secure cryptosystem coding gain as well as security can be achieved without incurring additional overhead on data transmitted in communication channel. \n /Remark: Completed with Excellent grade from SAC, ISRO/.
